Hello! I am currently leading a Data Science team at Rivian, focusing on ML & analytics for batteries. Prior to Rivian, I spent about 4.5 years at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) as a [researcher](https://github.com/MuratAykol-TRI). 

Most of my [recent published work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7JNUMRAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) is centered on combining machine learning with physics and chemistry to accelerate R&D. Among a few, these two deserve the spotlight as open-source Python libraries:

ðŸš€ [github.com/TRI-AMDD/CAMD](https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/CAMD): an end-to-end autonomous computational platform for closed-loop optimization. It was the Bayesian optimization & workflow engine behind a few papers:
[1](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/sc/d0sc01101k), [2](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.abj5505), [3](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62017c5949bd324dab48919f).

ðŸš€ [github.com/TRI-AMDD/piro](https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/piro): a recommendation system that combines physics (of nucleation) with ML-inspired approximations to find feasible synthesis routes for compounds. Check out this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c04888) to learn more.

âš¡ Fun fact: I update this github account every few years!
